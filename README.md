# Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The system can detect gestures such as Right, Left, Rotate, Straight, and Back.

## Introduction

Hand gesture recognition has various applications in human-computer interaction, sign language recognition, and virtual reality. This project focuses on real-time detection and classification of hand gestures using computer vision techniques.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.2
- OpenCV==4.5.4.60
- MediaPipe==0.10.9
- NumPy==1.24.3
- cvzone==1.6.1

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy cvzone
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VivekSai07/Hand-Gesture-Detector.git
```
2. Run the Python script:
```bash
python HandGestureRecognition.py
```
