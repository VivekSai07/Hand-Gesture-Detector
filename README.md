# Hand-Gesture-Detector
This Python script implements real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It detects and classifies gestures such as Right, Left, Rotate, Straight, and Back. The system captures video input from a webcam, processes it to isolate the hand, and then applies classification to determine the gesture being performed.
